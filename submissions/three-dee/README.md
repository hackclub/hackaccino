## How many hours did you spend on this?

Hours: 1

## How did you build this?

Using the tutorial slides and looking at C-Frame.
This is not my final submission, I found out this was ending today a few hours back and wanted to build a maze but couldn't figure out how to get collisions working between the player and objects in the CFrame library. 
I temporarily created an HC just to get a submission in before the deadline. I'll try to figure it out sometime in the next few days, if possible help would be appriciated :)
