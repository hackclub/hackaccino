- **ESC** → Exit free look mode

### Tips
- Start by clicking to enable free look mode
- Use mouse wheel to find your comfortable movement speed
- Explore objects from different angles by looking up and down
- Click while in free look mode to create explosion effects in front of you

## Technology Stack

- **Three.js (r128)** - 3D graphics library
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with WebGL support
- Internet connection (for Three.js CDN)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tareq-Khalil/The-Sparkling-World.git
cd The-Sparkling-World
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve it with a local server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
- Mobile browsers with WebGL support

## Customization

### Adding New Objects
```javascript
// Add custom geometries to the geometries array
const geometries = [
    new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2),
    new THREE.SphereGeometry(1.5, 32, 32),
    // Add your custom geometry here
    new THREE.TorusGeometry(1, 0.4, 16, 100),
    new THREE.CylinderGeometry(1, 1, 2, 32)
];
```

### Modifying Colors
```javascript
// Customize the color palette
const colors = [
    0x00ffff, 0xff00ff, 0xffff00, 0x00ff00, 
    0xff0000, 0x0000ff, 0xff6600, 0x6600ff
    // Add your custom colors here
];
```

### Adjusting Performance
```javascript
// Reduce object count for better performance
for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) { // Reduced from 50
    // Object creation code
}

// Reduce particle count
for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) { // Reduced from 1000
    // Particle creation code
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Recommended Settings
- **Object Count**: 25-50 objects for optimal performance
- **Particle Count**: 500-1000 particles depending on device
- **Light Count**: 2-4 dynamic lights for balanced visuals

### Mobile Optimization
The project automatically adjusts for mobile devices, but you can further optimize by:
- Reducing object complexity
- Lowering particle counts
- Using simpler materials
- Implementing level-of-detail (LOD) systems
